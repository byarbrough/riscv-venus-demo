# RISC-V VS Code Venus Demo

Draw the RISC-V Logo with the [VS Code Venus Simulator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hm.riscv-venus) LED Matrix.

Simply clone, open in VS Code, install the recommended plugins
(`hm.riscv-venus` and `zhwu95.riscv`), then run and debug!

If the LED Matrix doesn't automatically open, use **Ctrl+Shift+P** then
`Venus: Open LED Matrix`.
